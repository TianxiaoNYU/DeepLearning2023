- This repo includes the codes for the whole project in the ./script folder.

  - Each sub-folder stands for the section for different task parts, which is self-descriptive.  
  - Note that all this code were run on the NYU langone BigPurple HPC. Most code-runing jobs are written as sbatch files in the slurm system. One can modify the codes to run them locally.
  - Some scripts use absolute directories. One can also modify them to make things run properly.
